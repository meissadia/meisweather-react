## Motivation

As part of a software development course, this project has been implemented to test my ability to build a small Single Page Application utilizing the React framework.

The project has been a fun exercise in composing applications from components and UI design.  It was a complex-enough refresher on managing State, using the React component lifecycle, and provided valuable experience integrating an external api ([OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)).

## Made Possible By:

## Provisioning Requirements

Sign-up for a free [OpenWeather API Key](https://openweathermap.org/api) if you don't have one, then:
```

```
